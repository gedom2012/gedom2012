## 🔍 About Me

I'm a passionate and results-oriented Quality Engineer with over 6 years of experience ensuring the quality and reliability of web services, APIs, and payment platforms. I specialize in implementing robust test automation strategies across all layers of software development.

Currently, I lead the QA efforts at **Easypay**, where I define test strategies, build pipelines, and foster a quality-driven engineering culture within agile teams.

I enjoy transforming manual processes into scalable, automated solutions and mentoring teams on quality best practices.
